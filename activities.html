        <p> Dubbed "The City Beautiful," Coral Gables is known for its tree-lined boulevards, ivy-covered mansions and historical landmarks such as the world-famous Biltmore Hotel and the Venetian Pool, both built in the 1920s.</p>

        <p> The Museum’s mission is to celebrate, investigate and explore the civic arts of architecture and urban and environmental design, including fostering an appreciation for the history, vision, and cultural landscape of Coral Gables; promoting beauty and planning as well as historic and environmental preservation for a broad audience, including children, families, and community members, as well as local, regional, national and international visitors.</p>

        <p> University Park Country Club, the area's premier semi-private country club, is the must-play golf destination on Florida's Cultural Coast. The impeccable course conditions, casually elegant surroundings and friendly service offer the daily fee player a private club experience that is surprisingly affordable. </p>
